OpenOEM will Install programs from the Chocolatey repositories and can make some basic tweaks such as changing the UI color, seting up a wallpaper and removing the people button among other things. Simply run the executable and walk away, it will not require your attention anymore until it is done. 

You can configure OpemOEM however you want via either the [MasterRaceGeeks website](https://openoem.masterracegeeks.eu/) or by manually editing the configuration file using a simple text editor.
